🧠 Digit Recognition Using CNN

A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the well-known MNIST dataset.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a CNN model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits.
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset consisting of thousands of labeled digit images.

This project follows a standard machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing to model saving.

🚀 How It Works
1. Data Handling

The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras.

Pixel values are normalized (scaled between 0 and 1).

Basic data exploration is performed using Pandas.

2. Model Building

A CNN architecture is designed using Keras Sequential API.

Model is compiled with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

3. Training & Evaluation

The model is trained on the training portion of MNIST.

Performance is validated using the test dataset.

Metrics such as accuracy are used to evaluate effectiveness.

4. Deployment Preparation

The final trained model is saved so it can be used later without retraining.
